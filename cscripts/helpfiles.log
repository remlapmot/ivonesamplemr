Title

    ivonesamplemr -- commands for one-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) /
        instrumental variable (IV) analyses.

    https://github.com/remlapmot/onesamplemr-stata#readme

Commands

      ivasmm        Is simply a helpfile linking to ivregress and ivreg2,
                      which as linear IV estimators fit the additive
                      structural mean model (ASMM), i.e. estimates a causal
                      risk difference for a binary outcome.

      ivlsmm        Fits the (double) logistic structural mean model (LSMM),
                      i.e. estimates a causal odds ratio for a binary
                      outcome.

      ivmsmm        Fits the multiplicative structural mean model (MSMM),
                      i.e. estimates a causal risk ratio for a binary
                      outcome.

      ivtsps        Fits two-stage predictor substitution (TSPS) estimators.

      ivtsri        Fits two-stage residual inclusion (TSRI) estimators.

Description

    ivonesamplemr is a suite of programs implementing various instrumental
    variable (IV) estimators for individual level (a.k.a. one-sample) data.
    These are useful for Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses.

Title

     ivasmm -- Additive structural mean model

Description

    ivasmm is not a command. This helpfile is to note that the additive
    structural mean model (ASMM) is simply fit with a linear IV estimator
    available in ivregress or ivreg2 or even implemented yourself with gmm.

For a binary outcome the ASMM estimates a causal risk difference.

Examples

    Simulate binary outcome data; y outcome, x exposure, w covariate, z*
    instrumental variables (genotypes).

        . drop _all
        . set obs 2500
        . set seed 12345
        . gen z1 = rbinomial(2, .2)
        . gen z2 = rbinomial(2, .3)
        . gen z3 = rbinomial(2, .4)
        . gen u = rnormal()
        . gen w = rnormal()
        . gen x = z1 + z2 + z3 + w + u + rnormal()
        . gen logitpy = -2 + x + w + u
        . gen py = invlogit(logitpy)
        . gen y = rbinomial(1, py)
        . gen x1 = x
        . gen x2 = rnormal()

    Fit the model with a single instrumental variable.

        . ivregress 2sls y (x = z1)

    Fit the model with multiple instruments.

        . ivregress 2sls y (x = z1 z2 z3)

    Fit the model with multiple exposures, and instruments, and adjusting for
    w.

        . ivregress 2sls y w (x1 x2 = z1 z2 z3)
